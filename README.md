## Description

In this project I had the task of building a project that only used JavaScript to randomly display questions and dynamically change the color, divs and buttons.

## Installation

There is nothing to install here all need here is to navigate to the website and give it a go.

## Usage

To use the program simply visit the site and click the start button. You will then be ask questions as the timer runs. Be quick and get a higher score. Good luck.

## How it works

### 1) This html has the bare bones of my project. Here we can see all the divs I need. They will be hidden and shown dynamically depending when I need it.

### 2) My css has nothing special, except here I declare if I want the div to be show with display: none or show.

### 3) In this document I declared an array of questions, answers and correct answer that will be parsed randomly.

### 4) To give the quiz a score keeper I add the score and initials to local storage. There I am able to pull and render it through a for each iteration.
